You **MUST NOT** use `<h1>` tags. You must use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>` tags for all text content.\n3. For responsive styles, you *must* only use `md:` and `xl:` prefixes.\n4. To make headlines pop, you MUST wrap key words in `<span>` tags with creative classes (e.g., gradient text, different colors).\n5. **All text**, even short links or phrases (like 'Learn more →'), **must** be wrapped in a block element like `<p>` or `<button>`.\n6.

    "user_template": "Generate the design JSON for the following component. The component is a 2-column grid layout where the columns stack vertically on mobile. Your task is to design the outer container shell (`parentClasses`), the shared typography theme (`defaultClasses`), and the specific styles for the individual columns (`columns`).\n\nComponent Brief: \"{{COPY_INPUT}}\"\n\nDesign Style: \"{{DESIGN_INPUT}}\"\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n1. You must respond with a JSON object with the top-level keys: `bgColour`, `parentClasses`, `defaultClasses`, and `columns`.\n2. The `parentClasses` value is for the OUTER container's spacing and width ONLY (e.g. `max-w-7xl`, `py-24`). It is **FORBIDDEN** to include `grid`, `grid-cols-*`, or `gap-*` properties in `parentClasses`. The application will handle the grid creation. Any response violating this rule will be rejected. The `parentClasses` value *must* be an ARRAY of objects.\n3. The `defaultClasses` value defines the theme and *must* be structured with responsive keys (`mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`) containing Tailwind class strings.\n4. The `columns` key *must* be an array containing exactly **two** objects. Each object represents an individual column and must have a `gridClasses` key. The value for `gridClasses` is a responsive object where each key's value is a string of Tailwind classes. This is used to style the column's wrapper. Crucially, you must remember that Tailwind is mobile-first, so you must reset styles at larger breakpoints if needed. For example, to add spacing for the mobile stack that is removed on larger screens, you would use `{ \"mobile\": \"mt-12\", \"tablet\": \"mt-0\" }`.\n5. Ensure the selected `bgColour` provides **high contrast** (meeting at least WCAG AA standards) with the primary text colors defined in `defaultClasses`. Prioritize readability.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n{\n  \"bgColour\": \"#0d1117\",\n  \"parentClasses\": [\n    { \n      \"mobile\": \"mx-auto max-w-7xl\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"mobile\": \"px-6 py-24\",\n      \"tablet\": \"px-8 py-32\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"defaultClasses\": {\n    \"h2\": {\n      \"mobile\": \"text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white\",\n      \"tablet\": \"text-6xl\"\n    },\n    \"p\": {\n      \"mobile\": \"text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300 mt-6\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"columns\": [\n    {\n      \"gridClasses\": {\n        \"mobile\": \"text-center\",\n        \"tablet\": \"text-left\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"gridClasses\": {\n        \"mobile\": \"flex flex-col items-center mt-12\",\n        \"tablet\": \"items-start mt-0\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
