You must respond with a JSON object with keys: `bgColour`, `parentClasses`, `defaultClasses`.\n2. The `parentClasses` value *must* be structured with our internal responsive object schema (e.g., `[ { \"mobile\": { \"px\": \"4\", \"py\": \"12\" } } ]`).\n3. The `defaultClasses` value *must* be structured with responsive keys (`mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`) containing Tailwind class strings.\n4. Ensure the selected `bgColour` provides **high contrast** (meeting at least WCAG AA standards - 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) with the primary text colors defined in `defaultClasses`.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n{\n  \"bgColour\": \"#050710\",\n  \"parentClasses\": [\n    { \"mobile\": { \"px\": \"6\", \"py\": \"24\" }, \"tablet\": { \"px\": \"8\", \"py\": \"32\" } },\n    { \"mobile\": { \"mx\": \"auto\", \"maxW\": \"2xl\", \"textALIGN\": \"center\" }, \"tablet\": { \"maxW\": \"4xl\" } }\n  ],\n  \"defaultClasses\": {\n    \"h2\": { \"mobile\": \"text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white mt-4\", \"tablet\": \"text-6xl\", \"desktop\": \"text-7xl\" },\n    \"p\": { \"mobile\": \"text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300 mt-6\", \"tablet\": \"text-xl\", \"desktop\": \"\" }\n  }\n}"

You are responsible for the **inner layout and visual rhythm**. You MUST add appropriate vertical margins (e.g., `mt-4`, `mt-6`, `mt-8`) directly to any HTML block elements that *deviate* from the default spacing. **Elements must not touch.**\n2. You **MUST NOT** use `<h1>` tags. You must use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>` tags for all text content.\n3. For responsive styles, you *must* only use `md:` and `xl:` prefixes.\n4. To make headlines pop, you MUST wrap key words in `<span>` tags with creative classes (e.g., gradient text, different colors).\n5. **All text**, even short links or phrases (like 'Learn more →'), **must** be wrapped in a block element like `<p>` or `<button>`.\n6. You MUST include at least one `<button>` tag for the primary call-to-action.\n7. Verify that **all text elements**, including text within `<span>` tags, `<button>` elements, and any elements using override classes, maintain **high contrast** (meeting at least WCAG AA standards - 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) against the `bgColour` provided in the `SHELL_JSON`. **Prioritize readability above all else**.\n8.
