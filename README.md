> **Stop building pages. Build a brand universe.**

## The Problem: The Web has Amnesia

Traditional websites treat every visitor like a stranger. Static technology forces you to serve the exact same generic monologue to everyone. Legacy tools suffer from **Intent Blindness** - they were built for page views, not signal clarity.

## The Solution: A Site That Listens

**TractStack v2.2** is an Adaptive Engine that acts as a triage nurse, not a brochure. It turns a fragile "page view" into a powerful, privacy-first user journey.

### 1. Generative Architecture

Don't settle for the "rigid" look of standard CMS platforms.

- **AI Design Creator:** Any section of your page can now be designed by prompt for complete creative control of images, text, and buttons.
- **Semantic Integrity:** Even with full creative freedom, content is extracted and stored as Markdown for full-text search and maximum SEO benefit.

### 2. Smart Triage

The logic engine empowers you to identify high-intent users instantly and accelerate them to conversion, while automatically nurturing the rest. You define content paths that only open when a user signals interest.

### 3. Total Memory (Privacy-First)

We moved "memory" from fragile third-party cookies to a proprietary server-side logic engine.

- **The Handshake:** First-party session management keeps the conversation fluid without external tracking.
- **The Kill Switch:** If a user revokes consent, the system immediately purges all session data and cookies.

## The Tech Stack

TractStack is a hybrid engine designed for performance and logic.

- **Frontend:** [Astro](https://astro.build) — The "Free Web" Press for SEO-ready HTML.
- **Backend:** Golang — A compiled engine that manages state, session continuity, and adaptive content.
- **Glue:** [HTMX](https://htmx.org) — Enables real-time, dynamic interactions without heavy client-side frameworks.
- **Data:** [Turso](https://turso.tech) — Scalable high performance, lightweight database.

## Quick Start

Visit [https://tractstack.com](Tract Stack dot com) for hosted plans. For the do-it-yourself folks, our one-line installer handles the heavy lifting:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.tractstack.com | bash
```

## Technical Scrutiny: Privacy & Continuity

- **Functional Persistence:** Uses `tractstack_session_id` for short-lived (24hr) functional continuity.
- **Hybrid Restoration:** Uses a secure "fingerprint" token to reconstruct sessions in RAM if the server restarts, ensuring continuity without permanent tracking.
- **Data Minimization:** Sensitive profile data (name, email) is stored in the user's browser `localStorage` rather than a centralized database by default.

---

## Roadmap v4.0

### Transcribe Integration

Expanding full-text search to include embedded video transcripts (via BunnyCDN).

- **AI Visual Editor:** Powered by AssemblyAI askLemur to highlight and extract transcript sections.
- **Smart Content:** Automated chaptering and descriptions for long-form video.
- **Video-to-Blog Pipeline:** Transform video highlights into rich, searchable blog pages using the design library.

### Future Infrastructure

- **HTMX 4.0 Migration:** Full alignment with the htmx 4.0 standard to ensure the platform remains at the cutting edge of hypermedia.
