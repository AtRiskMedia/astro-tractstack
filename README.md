## The Manifesto: The Web Has Amnesia

Traditional CMS software conquered the world by making publishing easy—but it broke the relationship. It treats every visitor like a stranger. It forces you to serve the exact same generic monologue to everyone, relying on invasive third-party tracking to guess who is reading.

## The "Free Web" Press Restores the Signal

**TractStack v2.2** is not just a CMS; it is a **Signal Continuity Engine**. It takes the concept of the "Press"—broadcasting ideas—and adds the "Handshake."

### 1. The Mass-Produced Handshake (Smart Triage)

Legacy tools suffer from **Intent Blindness**. The Free Web Press serves a dialogue.

- **Identify Intent:** Our logic engine acts like a triage nurse, identifying high-intent users instantly.
- **The Hidden Door:** You define content paths that only open when a user signals interest.
- **The Result:** You don't just "publish" a site; you press a branded universe that adapts to every visitor.

### 2. Generative Architecture (No-Code Freedom)

Don't settle for the "rigid" look of standard platforms.

- **AI Design Creator:** Design any section by prompt for complete creative control.
- **Semantic Integrity:** We extract content as Markdown for full-text search and maximum SEO benefit, ensuring your signal remains concrete even when the design is fluid.

### 3. Total Memory (Privacy as Infrastructure)

We moved "memory" from fragile third-party cookies (The Dependent Web) to a proprietary server-side logic engine (The Free Web).

- **The Handshake:** First-party session management keeps the conversation fluid without external tracking.
- **The Kill Switch:** True data sovereignty. If a user revokes consent, the system immediately purges the session.

## The Tech Stack

TractStack is a hybrid engine designed for performance and logic.

- **Frontend:** [Astro](https://astro.build) — The "Free Web" Press for SEO-ready HTML.
- **Backend:** Golang — A compiled engine that manages state, session continuity, and adaptive content.
- **Glue:** [HTMX](https://htmx.org) — Enables real-time, dynamic interactions without heavy client-side frameworks.
- **Data:** [Turso](https://turso.tech) — Scalable high performance, lightweight database.

## Quick Start

Visit [https://tractstack.com](Tract Stack dot com) for hosted plans. For the do-it-yourself folks, our one-line installer handles the heavy lifting:

## Technical Scrutiny: Privacy & Continuity

- **Functional Persistence:** Uses `tractstack_session_id` for short-lived (24hr) functional continuity.
- **Hybrid Restoration:** Uses a secure "fingerprint" token to reconstruct sessions in RAM if the server restarts, ensuring continuity without permanent tracking.
- **Data Minimization:** Sensitive profile data (name, email) is stored in the user's browser `localStorage` rather than a centralized database by default.

## Roadmap v4.0

### Transcribe Integration

Expanding full-text search to include embedded video transcripts (via BunnyCDN).

- **AI Visual Editor:** Powered by AssemblyAI askLemur to highlight and extract transcript sections.
- **Smart Content:** Automated chaptering and descriptions for long-form video.
- **Video-to-Blog Pipeline:** Transform video highlights into rich, searchable blog pages using the design library.

### Future Infrastructure

- **HTMX 4.0 Migration:** Full alignment with the htmx 4.0 standard to ensure the platform remains at the cutting edge of hypermedia.
