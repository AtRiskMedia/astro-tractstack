## epistemic hypermedia server

...a new species of web 2.0: an outcome of hybrid speciation.

The `tractstack-go` package provides a backend server for the `astro-tractstack` integration

Tract Stack makes it easy for non-technical people to build and grow adaptive websites that are fast, beautiful, SEO-ready, and accessible.

Tract Stack is built on [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and a [Golang](https://go.dev/) backend -- we recommend [Turso](https://app.turso.tech/) as database

## Documentation

Please visit [our docs](https://tractstack.org)

For production deployment you'll need to prepare your server.
